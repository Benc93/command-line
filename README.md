##Pre-course exercise: Command Line

####Summary of Activity 
    
This was the very first pre-course exercise on the Makers Academy curriculum.
     
It was a rather large tutorial that involved a great number of new concepts. The activites can be briefly summarised below: 
   
+ Introduction to the terminal.   
+ Basic commands (DATE, LS, PWD, CD). 
+ Creating/copying/moving/removing files.  
+ Basic concept of Streams, Pipes and redirection.
+ Basic Permissioning. 
+ The GREP command. 
+ The IRB suite. 
+ Creating Environment Variables. 
    
####Lessons Learned     
   
This was my first flurry into programming on the Makers Academy course. As far as lessons to take away - new concepts can be incredibly daunting even if they are apparently simple. They often require revisiting and much practical reinforcement before they become properly understood. The main lesson (and its not the first or last time it's been learned) is not to be discouraged when trying something new. You suck at it, and its ok - everybody does initially! 
   
This contents of this exercise were central to some of the subsequest challenges during the pre-course section.
